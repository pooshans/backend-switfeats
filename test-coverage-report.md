## Next Steps

1. Complete test coverage for the remaining service and repository layers:
   - Driver Service
   - Restaurant Service
   - Order Service

2. Implement integration tests between services.

3. Set up automated test coverage reporting as part of the CI/CD pipeline.

4. Add more comprehensive edge case testing for error scenarios.
